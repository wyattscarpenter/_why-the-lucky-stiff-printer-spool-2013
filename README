Preamble explaining this fork:

This is a folder, a project, a git repo, that contains a book. I am not entirely certain what the book and its author are called, but I like to call it “printer spool, 2013” by “_why the lucky stiff”. I'm not sure if you're supposed to put the _ in his name when you aren't shortening it, nor am I sure how best to capitalize either of those phrases, so luckily in my cover for the book I was able to stylize appropriately to elide these decisions. You can check out more _why stuff at https://viewsourcecode.org/why/ and, I suppose, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff.

Anyway, I have forked this project from https://github.com/steveklabnik/CLOSURE (to whom much credit is owed) in order to make slight aesthetic changes. I think the CLOSURE version is fine—I appreciate the "closure" programming/psychology pun, and I appreciate the real-world picture that makes up the beginning, evoking escape, color, relaxation, and ruby. However, as best I can tell (through minimal research), both of those things I have listed as appreciating are later embellishments, by Steve Klabnik (owner of the repo this repo is a fork from). The original collection of pages has no title page, title picture, or title. So, I wanted a slightly more neutral presentation and merely descriptive title, and also completely black&white. I have also included a table of contents (numberless, because the pages are unnumbered), taken from the readme below. ------------ in this table separates the test pages from the (subsequent) real pages.

The CLOSURE cover claims its order was checked against git history (https://github.com/cwales/cwales.github.com, a copy of which is in the tgz file in this repo) and a real-time printed copy. I have not also done this, at least not extensively, but I trust the CLOSURE ordering and contents. The CLOSURE cover claims, too, “pages flipped so you can read”; I'm not sure if this means all the pages or just some have been flipped, but I can in fact read all the pages as is, so I'm happy with whatever was done to them.

Conveniently, adding a title page and table of contents to this book makes an odd number of pages, so printing double-sided gives a blank back cover, as it were.

My contribution to this project, such as it is, is hereby released into the public domain under CC0. The original pages of the book are implied within the book to be released into the public domain. §Disclaimer, ¶2: “Now I want to make it perfectly clear that these papers and all my other works in life belong to the general public.”
